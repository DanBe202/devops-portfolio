# DevOps Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, my name is **Daniiel Opaiets**.  
I am a Computer Science student passionate about building efficient, reliable, and automated systems. My main interest lies in **DevOps practices**, where development meets operations to deliver faster, safer, and more scalable products.  

## Why DevOps?
I chose DevOps because it combines my interest in **software engineering** and **system administration**. I believe that the future of IT is in automation, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and monitoring. DevOps allows me to not only build software but also ensure it runs smoothly in production.  

## Goals & Learning Path
I am currently focusing on developing the following skills:
- **Linux & Bash scripting** for system management  
- **Docker & containerization** to build and run applications consistently  
- **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions and Jenkins  
- **Cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalable infrastructure  
- **Monitoring & observability** with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform and Ansible  

My long-term goal is to become a **DevOps Engineer** who can design and manage complex cloud-native systems with a strong focus on automation and reliability.
